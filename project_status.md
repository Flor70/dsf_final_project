# Flight Search and Weather Analysis Project - Status Report

## Current Functionality

### Flight Search
- Users can search for flights by selecting origin and destination airports
- Date selection for departure and return dates
- Automatic search for flights on weekends between selected dates
- Display of the three cheapest flights found
- Detailed flight information including:
  - Price
  - Airline
  - Departure and arrival times
  - Flight duration
  - Number of layovers
- Comparison table for easy comparison of flight options
- Search history tracking

### Weather Data
- Historical weather data retrieval for the destination city
- Display of temperature and precipitation statistics
- Monthly breakdown of weather patterns
- Year-by-year comparison of weather data
- Downloadable raw and aggregated weather data

### User Interface
- Clean and intuitive interface with Streamlit
- Responsive layout with appropriate sections
- Interactive elements for better user experience
- Data visualization with charts and graphs
- English interface with clear labels and instructions

## Pending Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Weather Data Visualization
- Improve the display of historical weather data charts
- Add average maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation data for each weekend with low flight prices
- Create a comparison view that allows users to choose between weekends based on both price and typical weather conditions


### 2. Flight Search API Integration Issues
- Verify the correct implementation of the `fetch_flights_serpapi` function
- Currently, it appears we're only getting one-way flight data instead of round-trip information
- Need to ensure that both departure and return flight data are properly fetched and displayed
- Review the SerpAPI parameters to ensure we're requesting round-trip flights correctly

### 3. Amadeus API Integration
- Implement the display of historical price trends using data from `amadeus.py`
- Create visualizations to show how current prices compare to historical averages
- Add price prediction indicators based on historical data
- Integrate the Amadeus price metrics into the flight search results for better context

### 4. Additional Enhancements
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Add caching for better performance
- Implement more filtering options for flight results
- Create a favorites or bookmarking system for interesting flights
- Add email notifications for price drops on saved routes

## Next Steps
1. Address the flight search API integration to ensure we get round-trip data
2. Enhance the weather data visualization to include weekend-specific information
3. Implement the Amadeus historical price data display
4. Conduct thorough testing of all features
5. Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback

## Technical Debt
- Some functions could benefit from better error handling
- Need to implement more comprehensive logging
- Consider refactoring some of the larger functions for better maintainability
- Add more comprehensive documentation for all modules
